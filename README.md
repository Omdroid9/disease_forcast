# Disease Forecasting Project

## Overview

This Python project aims to forecast diseases based on patient information, illness types, geographical location, and temporal factors. 
The model utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical patient data and predict potential disease outbreaks, providing valuable insights for public health initiatives.

This Python project is designed to forecast diseases by analyzing patient information, types of illnesses, geographical location, and time-related factors. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model identifies patterns in historical health data to predict potential disease outbreaks. The system aims to deliver timely alerts and insights that can aid in the early detection of health risks, enabling proactive intervention. It also provides a framework for data-driven decision-making in public health, allowing for more effective resource allocation and improved preparedness for future epidemics or localized disease events.
